I've built a Dribbble website clone using the React framework, focusing on the frontend. The design is based on Dribbble's layout, with a grid of design shots and profile pages. However, the design isn't fully responsive at this stage and requires further optimization for various screen sizes.

Deployed Link - https://dribble-blush.vercel.app

Key features of the clone include:

Static Data: All content is hardcoded, and there's no backend functionality yet.
Navigation Bar: A simple, fixed navigation bar allows access to different sections of the site.

The website is built with React, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm planning to improve its responsiveness and interactivity as the project progresses.
